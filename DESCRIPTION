Description: This package provides a variety of tools for the nonparametric
    estimation of causal effects across a wide range of settings. The methods
    are based on the theory of influence functions, and can incorporate flexible
    machine learning and high-dimensional regression tools, while still yielding
    inference in the form of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Many of
    the methods are doubly robust.
